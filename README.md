# Evaluating Progress Towards SDG 7 Through Machine Learning
## Project Overview
This project focuses on evaluating global progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Utilizing machine learning models, the project analyzes various data sources to understand and predict trends in energy access and sustainability.

## Objectives
 - Evaluate the current progress towards achieving SDG 7 on a global scale.
 - Identify factors influencing access to electricity and quality of energy supply.
 - Provide data-driven recommendations to stakeholders.

## Data Sources
Data for this analysis is sourced from the International Energy Agency (IEA), including:

 - World Energy Investment 2023 Data File
 - World Energy Balances Highlights 2023
 - Specific indicators related to SDG 7 from the Goal 7 Data set.

## Methodology
 1. Data Collection: Data is collected from the IEA database.
 2. Data Preprocessing: Includes cleaning, handling missing values, and data standardization.
 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze distributions, trends, and correlations in the data.
 4. Machine Learning Model Development: Implement models to analyze factors and predict future trends.
 5. Evaluation and Insights: Evaluate model performance and derive actionable insights.

## Expected Outcomes
 - Comprehensive report detailing the current state of global energy access and sustainability.
 - Identification of critical factors influencing SDG 7 progress and recommendations for policy and action.
