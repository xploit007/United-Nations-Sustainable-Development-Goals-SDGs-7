# Project Title

## Project Overview

This dynamic project employed Python, Excel, and Jupyter Notebook to clean, analyze, and visualize global energy access data in alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG-7) on affordable and clean energy.

### Key Steps

1. **Data Import and Assessment:**
   - Imported the raw dataset into Jupyter Notebook for a thorough data quality and completeness evaluation.
   - Identified and addressed significant data cleaning requirements, especially in handling missing values.

2. **Data Cleaning with Python:**
   - Utilized Python packages, including Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy, for data cleaning tasks.
   - Executed operations such as handling missing data, data transformations, and managing outliers.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis on the cleaned dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
   - Generated insightful visualizations, including histograms, heatmaps, and scatter plots.

4. **Pattern Identification and Trends:**
   - Employed advanced analysis techniques to identify patterns and trends related to energy access across countries and regions.
   - Conducted statistical analysis to quantify energy poverty and disparities.

5. **Excel-Based Data Visualizations:**
   - Created compelling data visualizations in Excel, including charts, graphs, and dashboards, to effectively present insights to stakeholders.

6. **Impactful Data Visualizations:**
   - Crafted impactful data visualizations illustrating energy disparities.

7. **Advanced Data Techniques:**
   - Applied advanced techniques to analyze and process data, identifying regions with limited access to renewable energy.
   - Contributed to the global assessment of SDG-7, highlighting critical energy disparities.

### Project Outcomes

The project provided hands-on experience using Python and Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Insights highlighted global energy poverty, driving social impact and contributing to the pursuit of Sustainable Development Goals.
