# United-Nations-Sustainable-Development-Goals-SDGs-7 Tableau Dashboard

## Project Overview:
This dynamic project employed Python, Excel, and Jupyter Notebook to clean, analyze, and visualize global energy access data in alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG-7) on affordable and clean energy.

Key Steps:
Data Import and Assessment:

Imported the raw dataset into Jupyter Notebook for thorough evaluation of data quality and completeness.
Identified and addressed significant data cleaning requirements, especially in handling missing values.
Data Cleaning with Python:

Utilized Python packages including Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy for data cleaning tasks.
Executed operations such as handling missing data, data transformations, and managing outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted exploratory data analysis on the cleaned dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Generated insightful visualizations including histograms, heatmaps, and scatter plots.
Pattern Identification and Trends:

Employed advanced analysis techniques to identify patterns and trends related to energy access across countries and regions.
Conducted statistical analysis to quantify energy poverty and disparities.
Excel-Based Data Visualizations:

Created compelling data visualizations in Excel, including charts, graphs, and dashboards to effectively present insights to stakeholders.
Impactful Data Visualizations:

Crafted impactful data visualizations illustrating energy disparities.
Advanced Data Techniques:

Applied advanced techniques to analyze and process data, identifying regions with limited access to renewable energy.
Contributed to the global assessment of SDG-7, highlighting critical energy disparities.
Project Outcomes:
The project provided hands-on experience in using Python and Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Insights delivered highlighted global energy poverty, driving social impact and contributing to the global pursuit of Sustainable Development Goals.
